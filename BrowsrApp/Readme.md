BrowsrApp

BrowsrApp is a simple iOS application that allows users to search for Github organizations and save their favorite organizations. The project is built using the MVVM architectural pattern and uses CoreData to persist user data.

Project Structure

The project consists of two main components: BrowsrApp and BrowsrLib.

BrowsrApp is the main application target that contains the user interface and the view models. The user interface is developed programmatically using Auto Layout constraints. BrowsrApp uses BrowsrLib as a dependency to fetch data from the Github API.

BrowsrLib is a Swift package that contains the network layer and the models for the Github API. The network layer is responsible for making API requests and parsing the response data into Swift models. The library also includes a set of unit tests to ensure that the library code works as expected.

The project also includes a Utils folder that contains a Reachability class to handle network status. The FavoriteOrganizationsManager class in the CoreData folder is responsible for managing the user's favorite organizations using CoreData.

Architecture

The project is built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. The model layer is implemented using the Swift models from BrowsrLib. The view layer is implemented using the view controllers and views in BrowsrApp. The view models in BrowsrApp act as the glue between the model and view layers.
